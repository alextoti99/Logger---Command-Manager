# Logger---Command-Manager
A program, which will be able to log texts from a game/program and send commands to it (C#).

How to install.
Edit the Vars.cs for both folders (they should be the same).
Create 2 new projects, 1 for the server and 1 for the client.

Add the files for each and compile.

The client is made in unity, but it can be changed easily.
